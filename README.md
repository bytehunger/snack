# snack
A simple static site generator to build modular pages.

## Usage
First, make sure that your theme can be found inside your root directory under
`/themes/theme-name`. Then inside your root directory run the command:

``` bash
snack --input site.json --output public/
```

This should create a folder in your root directory where you can find your
website files.
